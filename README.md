# Three clustering algorithms included in src/
## K-means(kmeans.h)
A K-means algorithm application with 7 dimensions data.
## DBSCAN(density.h)
A density based variant of DBSCAN algorithm, also deals with 7 dimensions data.
## KD(mine.h)
My improved algorithm. Pre-clustering data by using 4 dimensions and then using density based algorithm to cluster data.

# Get executable file
1. Run "make" to obtain the executable main file. 
2. Directly call python files to get corresponding plots for 3 algorithms.

# Dataset
Using the data of SDSS via <www.sdss.org>.
